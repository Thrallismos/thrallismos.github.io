I created an online radio that you can open in a window or listen to it right now in this post because it is embed from [Radio Tuna](http://radiotuna.com/). It is nice metal player with three stations: viking, black and death metal. It displays which station is playing, what song is it and which band plays it. **Enjoy yout listening and rock/metal on! \m/**
